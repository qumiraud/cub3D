# Libft

**My first project at 42: building my own C standard library from scratch, mastering memory management and fundamental C programming.**

## Objectives
- Deepen understanding of memory management (malloc, free).
- Strengthen the foundations of the C language (pointers, types, loops, conditions).
- Practice writing clean, robust, and norm-compliant code.
- Create a personal toolkit for upcoming projects.

## Skills developed
- Writing functions without relying on external libraries.
- Manipulating strings, arrays, and basic data structures.
- Handling errors carefully to prevent undefined behavior.
- Working under strict coding standards (42 coding norm).
